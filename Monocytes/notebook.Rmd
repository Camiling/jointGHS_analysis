# Data description

Using a FDR threshold of $0.05$ for hotspot association, we get $p=381$ genes for each of the four conditions. We have $n_1=366$ samples for IFN-GAMMA, $n_2=260$ for LPS-2h, $n_3=321$ for LPS-24h, and $n_4=413$ for unstimulated cells. The number of genes in each condition mediated by the top hotspot were $294$, $88$, $16$ and $215$ respectively.

# Resulting network description 

The jointGHS network estimates had sparsities $0.18$, $0.20$, $0.21$ and $0.16$ for IFN-GAMMA, LPS-24, LPS-24h and unstimulated cells respectively. Their corresponding  chosen global shrinkage parameters were $8$ $6.4$, $9$ and $3$ respectively. 

Compared to the single-network estimates of the same sparsity, the log likelihood is either increased or approximately the same for all conditions.

# Similarity of networks across conditions

Using Matthews' correlation coefficient for networks, we see that the networks of IFN-gamma and LPS24h are the most different to each other.

<!--This is confirmed by the hierarchical clustering algorithm applied to the data. We also see that LPS-2h is more similar to the unstimulated condition than LPS24h is. -->

# Degree distributions 

## LYZ

LYZ has a relatively high degree in all conditions, though it is not among the top hubs in any of the conditions. It does not have any edges to other cis genes, except for in LPS-24 where there is an edge between LYZ and YEATS4. In fact, this is the only cis-cis edge across all conditions. This implies that the cis genes work independently, and do not regulate each other. 

![Degree distributions of jointGHS networks, with edge degree of LYZ marked in red](plots/degreedistributions/degreedistr_LYZ_combined_jointGHS.pdf){width=50%}


## YEATS4

YEATS4 also has a high edge degree in all networks, and is clearly a hub. 


![Degree distributions of jointGHS networks, with edge degree of YEATS4 marked in red](plots/degreedistributions/degreedistr_YEATS4_combined_jointGHS.pdf){width=50%}

## CREB1

The mediator trans gene CREB1 also has a fairly high degree in all networks.

## Density plots

It apprears that the degree distribution of the unstimulated network has more density on lower degrees. Indeed, the unstimulated network is the sparsest among the four.

![Degree distributions density of jointGHS networks](plots/degreedistributions/degreedistr_density_jointGHS.pdf){width=50%}


## Density plots of top hotspot-controlled genes

The degree distribution of the genes controlled by the top hotspot clearly has the most mass on larger values in LPS-24h, also when compared to the distribution in the joint network estimate, implying more activity among these genes in this group.

![Degree distributions density of genes controlled by the top hotspot in the jointGHS networks](plots/degreedistributions/degreedistr_density_onlyflagged_jointGHS.pdf){width=50%}


## Density plots of single network version

As we see, the single network estimates does not have nodes with degree larger than 25, compared to 40 for the joint estimate. Thus, the joint graphical horseshoe estimator identifies more high-degree hubs. 

![Degree distributions density of fastGHS networks](plots/degreedistributions/degreedistr_density_single_jointGHS.pdf){width=50%}



# Hubs

It can be relevant to investigate whether the conditions have common hubs. For this purpose, we consider hubs to be the nodes with edge degree larger than the $90$th percentile. This resulted in four lists with $56$, $46$, $49$ and $48$ genes for IFN-GAMMA, LPS-2h, LPS-24h and the unstimulated network respectively. The top hubs common to all four networks were: ACBD5, AFMID, AFTPH, AIRE, COX6A1, GIMAP1, IMPDH1, KIAA0101, LGALS3, RELB, SLC3A2, SORL1 and STAG3L3. 

LYZ and YEATS4 had many edges with the top hubs in all conditions. YEATS4 in particular is highly connected to the top hubs in each network, in addition to being a top hub in all networks but that of LPS-2h. 

Looking at the location of the top hubs, we see that they are fairly well spread out. 

![The location of the top hubs in the different conditions, with the 12th chromosome marked in pink](plots/tophubs_jointGHS.pdf){width=50%}

As we see from the heatmap, the unstimulated group and LPS-24h have the fewest common hubs. 

<!--Using hierarchical clustering to group the conditions based on common hubs, we see that LPS-2h and LPS-24h are clustered together.-->

# Resulting networks

## Edges of LYZ gene

In the figure showing the subgraph with the edges of LYZ in the different conditions, a red edge indicates that the edge is unique to that condition. A blue edge is common across all networks, and a grey edge is present in two or three networks. Solid lines represent positive partial correlation while a dashed line represents negative partial correlation. Nodes are sized according to their edge degree, with larger size representing a higher degree. 

As we see, LYZ does not have a striking number of neighbors in IFN-GAMMA. On the other hand, it has more edges in the others, in particular LPS-2h which also has the most unique edges. We see that a lot of the edges of LYZ represent negative partial correlations, implying it could have a role in trans down-regulation in addition to up-regulation. 

The neighbors of LYZ common in the four networks are AFMID, LOC100128098, KLHL28, MAFF and SNRNP48. The partial correlations between LYZ and the the latter genes are negative in all conditions, and positive for the two former.

## Edges of YEATS4 gene

YEATS4 has a high degree in all networks, and is among the top $10%$ hubs in all networks but that of LPS-2h. Evidently, it has many edges, corresponding to both positive and negative partial correlations. It is the cis gene with the overall highest degree in all conditions. 

![Subnetwork showing the edges from YEATS4 in the joint estimate](plots/YEATS4_net_circle_jointGHS.pdf)

## Edges of CREB1 gene

We also look at the edges of the trans gene CREB1, as it is found to have a mediating effect. CREB1 does not have any edges to the cis genes. 

![Subnetwork showing the edges from CREB1 in the joint estimate](plots/CREB1_net_circle_jointGHS.pdf)

## Edges of both LYZ and YEATS4 genes

We also show the edges of the two cis genes controlled by the top hotspot together.

![Subnetwork showing the edges from all genes in cis in the joint estimate](plots/CIS_net_circle_jointGHS.pdf)

## Full network

We also include the full network with all edges, though little can be concluded from this plot.

# Network intersection

## All edges

As we see from the intersection plot, the networks have a fair share of edges in common. After the intersection of all conditions, the intersection with the largest edge set is LPS-2h and LPS-24h. This agrees with what we have seen previously.

## Hubs

## joint vs single GHS

Comparing to the single GHS networks, we see that the joint networks have more in common. This is as expected, that we with the joint method are able to identify what is common and borrow information. From the upset plots, we see that much individuality is captured as well. The log likelihood improvement supports that the estimates have improved compared to the single-network method.

# All genes

We see that in the unstimulated group, more genes are further than three links from the cis genes compared to the other conditions. Many genes do not have any paths to the cis genes at all.

# Common parameter estimates

As we see, while many edges are found to be in common so that information is shared, there are still many network-specific edges that have been captured. Thanks to the heavy horseshoe tail, we were able to capture these edges even though no common information about them was found between the conditions.

# Are the top hotspot mediated gene subnetworks denser?

## Subnetworks of top hotspot mediated genes

The subnetworks of the top hotspot mediated genes were found to be sigificantly denser than the overall networks in all conditions, with empirical p-values being $0.0001$ in all conditions except IFN-GAMMA, which had p-value $0.08$. 

## Neighbour genes of cis genes

We see that YEATS4 does not really have more mediated neighbours than the overall fraction, except in LPS-24h. CREB1 has more mediated neighbours in all conditions, and in fact *all* its neighbours are mediated in IFN-GAMMA and the unstimulated cells. LYZ also has more mediated neighbours in all conditions, though not very much more in IFN-GAMMA.

In LPS-24h, all genes have more mediated neighbours. The number of top hotspot mediated genes is lower in this group.
